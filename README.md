## üëë Admin System

The application includes an admin dashboard for managing the hotel system. Only users with admin privileges can access this feature.

### Features of the Admin Dashboard
- Comprehensive overview of bookings, users, and rooms
- User management
- Bookings management
- Room management

### How to Make a User an Admin
To grant admin privileges to a user:

1. The user must first register and have an account
2. Access the MongoDB database
3. Find the 'users' collection
4. Locate the document corresponding to the user you want to make an admin
5. Update the document and set `isAdmin: true`
6. Save the changes

Once set as an admin, the user will see an "Admin Dashboard" option in their profile dropdown menu.

### Security
- Admin routes are protected on both client and server sides:
  - **Client-side Protection**:
    - Protected route components using React Router
    - Route guards that check for admin status before rendering
    - Automatic redirection to login page for unauthorized access
    - Admin status verification through JWT token validation
    - Secure storage of admin status in protected context

  - **Server-side Protection**:
    - JWT-based authentication middleware
    - Role-based access control middleware
    - Admin-specific API endpoints with additional validation
    - Request validation and sanitization
    - Secure session management
    - Rate limiting for admin routes
    - IP-based access restrictions (optional)
    - Activity logging for audit purposes

- MongoDB security rules ensure that only admin users can perform administrative actions
- Non-admin users attempting to access the admin dashboard will be redirected

## üîß Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hotel-booking-react.git
cd hotel-booking-react
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash

  MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
  PORT=5000
  ```
- Start the backend server:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

4. Start the development server
